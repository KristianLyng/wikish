Wikish is a basic shell script to edit a mediawiki wiki

Dependencies in order of what you're least likely to already have:

	lwp-request (with ssl-support if you use https. SSLeay )
	curl
	gawk (I think. Might work with mawk too)
	bash
	diff (For EDIT-mode)
	date
	sh (meh....)
	mv
	cp

Installation: Just run it and it'll whine at you. Basically move
wikish.config to ~/.config/, edit it and then set up wiki.sh somewhere. It
creates a few trash-files so you may want to keep it in a directory.
